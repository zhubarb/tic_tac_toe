# tic_tac_toe
Your task is to create an agent that learns to play a game of tic-tac-toe. It's up to you to decide the training method:

- implementing a teacher that knows the optimal strategy

- bootstrapping two random agents against themselves

- train the agent yourself and store its state for us to load
or any other approach. However the trained agent should learn the value or action-value function or policy for each state purely from game play, rather than from knowing the rules and heuristics of the game. Code should be written in C++. If you prefer to use a different language, please check with us first.

Use Q-learning and Sarsa to solve the problem. Plot a reward per episode graph for both algorithms.

SARSA http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node64.html
Q-learning http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node65.html

We will assign high weight to good code documentation and style. Please include unit tests in your project. Only spare time should be spent on presentation of game play, text output to terminal is sufficient. Also we expect the agent to be pretty good at the game.

Let me know if you have any questions
